<h2>Can knowledge be the main character ?</h2>
<p>When I started to read Orb, I didn't know anything about the story, and found
an interesting one in Rafal's ventures in astronomy. What quickly became obvious
was how gore some scenes are, and that Rafal has an incredible scientific 
intuition when it comes to completely think against the natural laws he knew. 
Like, he established the basic laws of heliocentric theory in less that a week, 
studying only during the night because he's still a high school student.</p>

<p>This beginning was rather interesting, because the author sets the "inception" 
concept: when an idea is in somebody's mind, it will stay forever. However, I 
didn't expect the story to take this dramatic turn to its end, making Rafal go 
to death in 150 pages, while the manga has 7 volumes following. This is when 
I understood that no character would last long.</p>

<p>Unfortunately my feelings turned out to a worse reality. Most of the parts in
the manga give this feeling of a series of small stories about various people 
believing in the same theorem, but only linked by this thin belief. 
I completely understand the philosophical meaning described by this lingering 
idea that grows stronger and stronger between generations, but it inevitably creates
characters that are either underdeveloped, exaggerated, or ephemeral. Either 
way, it's hard for me to cling to a story without a character whom I can follow
the thoughts, the feelings, the fears etc.</p>

<p>In general, this manga has a great potential of philosophy, and can be 
enjoyed as a dark reading. I found way too much gore for me, but it only depicts
the situation in Europe back then. I even think this is a way to convey that if
a mere mortal is frail and fragile, the thoughts he puts on paper and passes to
the next generations is almost immortal, and thus the truth is the strongest 
among humans. This is obviously a romanticised utopia of science and knowledge,
that falls into unrealism when it comes to people learning and discovering 
things.</p>

<p>The end of the story represents really well what I mean. The (newly main) 
character hears about the theory randomly, thinks "It's dumb. But what if ???", 
he is drawn pensive, and a bunch of lines describes the evolution of heliocentrism 
for the following years. I don't know if I'm being stubborn about how scientific 
thoughts should occur, but this is clearly not a satisfying way to describe 
someone building up the one of the most important theory of that era, and the
manga ended on a bitter note for me.</p>

<h3>More about characters</h3>

<p>As I said in the introduction, most of the characters are not deeply developed,
because they don't have enough time to be. Some of them are an absolute 
representation of their personality, or fall behind the stereotypes of the other 
characters, like Oczy who only follows the scientists without a proper personal 
goal. It would be wrong however to say that all of them were uninteresting, and
they all hold a bit of a particularity that make them meaningful to the story.
The story witnesses the evolution of Nowak, who is clearly the most convinced 
character overall, going from a simple anti-heliocentric to someone dedicated to
his beliefs, questioning himself when his end is near, just like Piast. Since
he is the character surviving the longest, the lore around him slowly develops,
and he represents very well the lingering adversity.</p>

<p>If the short-lived characters didn't help to get attached to them, it's a 
shame that new characters are never introduced relative to others, but only as
themselves. Some appear out of nowhere, others become the subject of the story
without reason, and they only convey to the same point thanks to the evolution 
of the plot.</p>

<h3>A little note about visuals</h3>

<p>The overall art feels really modern, even a bit sketchy in the beginning,
but it didn't really bother me. In fact, as I read mostly on my computer, I
could see some page-to-page transitions that were pretty well made, and the drawings
quickly evolve toward a more mastered feeling — faces are more consistent, wide
landscapes become more detailed etc. I didn't pay attention to the stars and sky 
representation however, since I don't know much about astronomy.</p>

<p>Again, it was all too much gore for me, and even if <em>most</em> of the scenes
are not too explicit, they are brutal in their own way of describing the events.
I don't know if the anime removed some gore episodes, but I think it would be even
worse when animated and with sound.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>It was a pretty tough reading, not because of the plot, but rather because of
a lot of things around, like the characters and visuals. In the end, even if I
think I kind of understand the meaning of the story, I don't keep an overall good
memory of this manga, which is definitely personal. I would still recommend 
reading it, keeping in mind that it is gore and not realistic enough to be read 
as a classic adventure.</p> 

<p>I give Orb a good but could-be-better <strong>7/10</strong>.</p>
