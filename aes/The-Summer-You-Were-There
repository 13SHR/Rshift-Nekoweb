<h2>Love and death through writing</h2>
<p>Hello everyone, and welcome to my review about The Summer You Were There, a very cute yet philosophically deep manga ! Reading this was an awesome experience, I loved almost all aspects of it after understanding the story.</p>

<p>In the beginning, the art did not appeal to me because it is very modern, but it is quite efficient to convey the emotions and the complexity of feelings that both characters have. The dark and blurry thoughts of Shizuku when thinking about her past are written in dark frames, the environment slowly disappears when she drowns in despair... Everything is put together to display her deep thoughts.</p>

<p>Speaking of characters, Shizuku may seem a bit out of reality, very distant to what is around her, but she becomes aware of Kaori's feelings afterward, maybe was it because she was blinded by her thoughts ? It may sound exaggerated in some situations (like when she didn't understand Kaori liked reading), but it remains understandable. <br>
If Kaori is very mysterious in the first chapters, she quickly becomes the most adorable character one could think of, as a cute girlfriend who thinks about nothing but to make her girlfriend happy. Then, she simply becomes the main purpose of the whole plot, even if Shizuku is the main character. By setting the despair of her being sick, and adding the ominous aspect of time over their relationship, she monopolizes the thoughts of Shizuku and the reader.<br>
The only negative thing I can think about is that the girl Shizuku bullied, Ruri, feels off the plot and not as useful as she could be. It seems like she is just here to give an excuse for Shizuku's feelings, and to show off Kaori's altruism. Moreover, her story shows some details that feel off, like she was very clearly bullied by Shizuku, and no adult could see that ? Like Shizuku was supposed to talk loud and be proud of everything she said, and no teacher would hear her saying that Ruri is nothing but trash ? I would say she was not the one at fault here, a child that is supported by adults to do something can't always think for themselves.<br>
Lastly, the character development in the bonus chapter is interesting, but not very much linked with the main story. It's always good to see everyone living their life against death, but this idea was much more developped before. Thus, I wouldn't consider this chapter as relevant.</p>

<p>I think what stands out of the story is that platonic relations may be the best way of enjoying life along with someone else. During the entire series, even if they were dating, they only hugged once or twice, the real love here is expressed with thoughts, through words, are they written or spoken. And maybe it is biaised by my social culture, but I feel like the yuri create a very sheer, pure romance. And I actually fell in love with Yuri at the same time.</p>

<p>Now, onto the hard part. The main obvious lesson here is about death and fatality. All characters fight against their weaknesses, struggling with past issues, while Kaori is the only one that seems to be completely free, because she is aware that it's impossible for her to fight. And still, she is human. When facing death, all she could say was "I don't want to die without seeing you again". This sentence was real hard to read, it is simple, yet it tells everything. Kaori regained a goal in life in Shizuku's love, only to make fatality more painful to accept. A pain that cannot be relieved, anything lived reminds of death - the aquarium reminded her that there may be no tomorrow. Fighting this pain is useless, then why continue to live ? Her answer would be "love".</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>You may already have understood that it was a tough manga for me to read, it left me with sorrow, knowing that some people in my relatives also have chronic diseases. I was really near tearing up at when reading the conclusion of the main story, and I think I won't forget these moments before long. Both the philosophical message and the emotions are perfectly conveyed. It is an obvious 10/10 for me.</p>
